## Local Setup

To setup Smart Agri locally, you'll need:

- pnpm installed (our package manager of choice)
- A database (we recommend PostgreSQL)

Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository

2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`

3. Create a `.env` file with your database URL and other secrets (ask a maintainer for an example)

4. Start local supabase development: `pnpm supabase start`
