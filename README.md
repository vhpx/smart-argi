## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (v9+)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (latest)

> [!NOTE]  
> Check out why we recommend using pnpm instead of npm by checking out their [motivation](https://pnpm.io/motivation) and [feature comparison](https://pnpm.io/feature-comparison).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tutur3u/platform.git
   cd platform
   ```

2. **Configure Tiptap Pro Registry:**

   > Before installing dependencies, you need to configure Tiptap Pro registry access. Visit [cloud.tiptap.dev/pro-extensions](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/pro-extensions) and login, then find your auth token in the "Global setup (for CI/CD)" section. Run these commands:
   >
   > ```bash
   > npm config set "@tiptap-pro:registry" https://registry.tiptap.dev
   > npm config set "//registry.tiptap.dev/:_authToken" [AUTH_TOKEN]
   > ```
   >
   > Replace [AUTH_TOKEN] with your actual token from the Tiptap dashboard.

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

4. **Start the Supabase local development environment:**

   ```bash
   pnpm sb:start
   ```

   This will provide the necessary URLs and keys for local development.

5. **Create environment files:**

   Create a `.env.local` file in each app directory (`apps/*/.env.local`) using the corresponding `.env.example` template and add the Supabase URLs and keys from the previous step.

6. **Start the desired application(s):**

   Use the appropriate pnpm scripts to start the applications.

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages (without requiring a local setup), run the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

To stop development apps and packages that are running on your local machine, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm stop
```

#### Supabase

To start a local supabase instance (database), run the following command:

```bash pnpm
pnpm sb:start
```

> [!NOTE]
> This command will start a local supabase instance on your machine. You can access the **Supabase Studio Dashboard** by visiting <http://localhost:8003>
>
> You can access the **InBucket service** that handles all email sending operations on your local machine by visiting <http://localhost:8004>

#### Supabase Prerequisites

> [!WARNING]
> You need to have Docker installed and running on your machine to start a local
> supabase instance.

### Stop Local Supabase Instance

To stop the local supabase instance, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm sb:stop
```

#### Better Development Experience

In case you want to run all local development servers, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm devx
```

Running `devx` will:

1. Stop the currently running supabase instance and save current data as backup (if there is any)
2. Install all dependencies
3. Start a new supabase instance (using backed up data)
4. Start all Next.js apps in development mode

If you want to have the same procedure without the backup, you can run `pnpm devrs` instead. This will:

1. Stop the currently running supabase instance (if there is any)
2. Install all dependencies
3. Start a new supabase instance (with clean data from seed.sql)
4. Start all Next.js apps in development mode

> In case you don't want to run a local supabase instance, you can run `pnpm dev` instead.

#### Local development

There are 5 seed accounts that are already set up for local development:

1. <local@tuturuuu.com>
2. <user1@tuturuuu.com>
3. <user2@tuturuuu.com>
4. <user3@tuturuuu.com>
5. <user4@tuturuuu.com>

### Test

To run all tests, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm test
```

> Note: Tests are still a work in progress. We're currently working on adding tests to all packages to ensure the best quality possible.

## Additional Information

### Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions! Please read our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines on how to submit pull requests, report issues, and suggest improvements. If there is any security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by following our [security policy](./SECURITY.md). For more detailed information, please refer to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Supabase connection issues**: Ensure Docker is running and you've correctly set the Supabase URLs and keys in your `.env.local` files.
2. **Build errors**: Make sure you're using the correct Node.js version (v20+) and have run `pnpm i` to install all dependencies.

### Performance Optimization

To improve build and development performance:

- Use `pnpm` for faster package installation and better disk space usage.
- Leverage Turborepo's caching capabilities by utilizing remote caching.
